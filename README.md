# Trouble in Minecraft

Trouble in Terrorist Town, in Minecraft.

Trouble in Terrorist Town is a popular game mode in Garry's Mod.

The objective of the game is simple. Traitors are to kill all of the innocents and detectives. The innocents and detectives have to kill the traitors. Innocents and detectives do not know who the traitors are. The detectives have additional tools to help find out who the traitors are and kill them.

## Types of Players

There are 3 types of players:

* Innocents
* Traitors
* Detectives

**Innocents**: Innocents are a majority of the game. Innocents are the most vulnerable. They can be killed by traitors and can be accused of being traitors, as the traitors are blended in with the innocent players. Players can find weapons in chests and use them to make themselves stronger and defend themselves against attacking traitors.

**Traitors**: The job of the traitors is to kill all innocent players. They can use weapons, just like innocent players, but also have access to a shop where they can buy traitor-only items to help them kill other players.

**Detectives**: The detectives have extra tools to help the innocents find out the traitors. Detectives are the only group of players that innocents can trust.

## Ending

The game ends only on two conditions:

* All innocents and detectives have been eliminated (traitors win)
* All traitors have been eliminated (innocents win)

## TODOs

This plugin will be developed to add more features to match the Garry's Mod version as much as possible. Here's a list of the things currently on our plate:

* Traitor shop (#2 - **COMPLETE**)
* Detective shop (#3 - **IN PROGRESS**)
* Karma system (#4 - **IN PROGRESS**)
* Traitor testers (#5 - **IN PROGRESS**)

## VoxelGamesLib

This project was made to showcase the capabilities of VoxelGamesLib, an in-development minigames framework. TTT is a great gamemode, however, and I believe that the existing solutions are lacking. This game will be actively maintained and I hope to bring it to feature-parity with the Garry's Mod version. Contributions are welcome.
